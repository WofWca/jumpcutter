  // You might ask "Why don't you just use the native [commands API](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/commands)?"
  // And the answer is â€“ you may be right. But here's a longer version:
  // * Our hotkeys are different from hotkeys you might have seen in videogames in the fact that ours are mostyly
  //   associated with an argument. Native hotkeys don't have this feature. We might have just strapped arguments to
  // native hotkeys on the options page, but it'd be a bit confusing.
  // * Docs say, "An extension can have many commands but only 4 suggested keys can be specified". Our extension has
  // quite a lot of hotkeys, each user would have to manually bind each of them.
  // * Native hotkeys are global to the browser, so it's quite nice when our hotkeys are only active when the
  // extension is enabled (with `enabled` setting) and is attached to a video.
  // * What gains are there? Would performance overhead be that much lower? Would it be lower at all?
  // * Keeps opportunities for more fine-grained control.
  // * Because I haven't considered it thorougly enough.
  //
  // Adding the listener to `document` instead of `video` because some websites (like YouTube) use custom players,
  // which wrap around a video element, which is not ever supposed to be in focus.
  //
  // Why not always attach with `useCapture = true`? For performance.
  // TODO but if the user changed `overrideWebsiteHotkeys` for some binding, an extension reload will
  // be required. React to settings changes?

    // `useCapture` is true because see `overrideWebsiteHotkeys`.
