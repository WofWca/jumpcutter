      //   associated with an argument. Native hotkeys don't have this feature. We might have just strapped arguments to
      // native hotkeys on the options page, but it'd be a bit confusing.
      // * Docs say, "An extension can have many commands but only 4 suggested keys can be specified". Our extension has
      // quite a lot of hotkeys, each user would have to manually bind each of them.
      // * Native hotkeys are global to the browser, so it's quite nice when our hotkeys are only active when the
      // extension is enabled (with `enabled` setting) and is attached to a video.
      // * What gains are there? Would performance overhead be that much lower? Would it be lower at all?
      // * Keeps opportunities for more fine-grained control.
      // * Because I haven't considered it thorougly enough.
